# Defining Badges
The most important thing about badges is that they reflect how the team sees themselves and therefore everyone who participates in the framework should be able to suggest badges and potential modifications to existing badges.  The framework defines badges for various disciplines these can be used and simply modified or you may wish to completely design your own.  In either case we recommend following the below process.

## What is a badge?
### Title
The title should be descriptive where possible, allowing the description ton only contain additional details....
## Description
What is this badge about, is there anything special I should know about?
## Levels
Describe the requirements on how you would acheive each level, follow the general structure for levels such as best in company, industry recognized.  If it is dificult to describe the requirements for a badge (see programming language for example), then you may need to define supplementary documentation which details each level.
## Further Info / Documentation
Links to any further information or documentation regarding the badge, for example of use please see the engineering skills badges.

## 1.0 Start high level
When analyzing a discipline first identify the desirable qualities, then start to break these down into technical competencies.

## 2.0 Discuss the competencies with the team
Whiteboard time, take your rough draft and go through it with the team, they are the people you are trying to describe and nobody knows them better than themselves.

## 3.0 Identify what each badge means to them
So you have identified that "Coaching" is a desirable skill, talk with the team and ask them what "Coaching" means to them.  This will help with the level of detail you need to put into the description and to identify if you need to create any supplementary documentation.

## 4.0 Produce a first draft
Take all the info you have gathered from your rough cut and the team meeting and write a first draft of your badges.  This should include all the necessary detail but do not spend too much time yet working on supplementary documentation.

## 5.0 Discuss with the team
Time to have all your hard work ripped to shreds, discuss the draft with the team, ensure they are happy that the title and description reflect the purpose of the badge and that everything is clear regarding what needs to be done in order to obtain the various levels.  Identify if you need to create any supplementary documentation to assist with progression.

## 6.0 Refine your draft
Refine your draft and create any additional documentation required producing a final(ish) version.
