# Defining Roles

* A role is built up from multiple competencies
* A role may be multi discipline
* Where possible do not create sub roles such as Senior / Junior, Senior Architect 2, etc.  The makeup of the individuals competencies will show the level of experience there is no need to represent this with a title.  The intention is to develop skills not to encourage title chasing, the flatter the role hierarchy the easier this will be
