# Standard Assesment Process
One criticism of many frameworks is that the assesment and development process are meaningless after they have been completed.  What most employees mean is that their line manager are not giving them the support and regular feedback with reference to thise documents in order for them to progress.  With this in mind when we are design ing this framework we decided that we would break things down into a bi-annual assessment with quarterly reviews.  Having 6 months between assessments should give the individual time to acheive meaningful goals and the process not being too arduous on the assessor.  The purpose of a formal catch up at the half way point is to have a detail discussion regarding the objectives and give a clear indicator to the assessed individual regarding the likelihood of success in reaching them.
In addition to this regular and informal catchups should be carried out at a duration of no greater than one month.  These do not need to be lengthy conversations but should be more on the form of a scrum meeting.  "Confess your sins, is there anything that will stop you from achieving your goals?".


## Flow (needs diagram)
*Assesment*
- 1.0 Run through framework
- 1.1 Prepare development profile
- 1.2 Discuss profile and agree

*Interim Assesment*
- 2.0 Discuss development profile in detail / fine tune objectives.

*Regular Management Retrospective*
- 3.0 Confess your sins - remove blockers


## 1.0 Run through framework
Every 6 months the report prepares an assessment of their *current* skills by selecting and rating themselves against badges they feel applicable. providing necessary evidence as required.  They then sit with their line manager and discuss this rating, the line manager will suggest areas where skills do not meet the required criteria as well as suggest areas where the individual has marked themselves to low.  A discussion about the personal aims and future objectives from three perspectives should be carried out:
1. The direction that the individual would like to advance their career.
2. Suggestions from the line manager based on their perceptions of the individuals strengths.
3. The current strategic requirements of the team or wider organization.


## 1.1 Prepare development profile
Once the current skills have been assessed the line manager then creates a skills development profile, this will include up to 4 badges which could be attained within the next 6 month period.  The idea is to make the profile challenging but obtainable, skills development is a positive process and this must be encouraged.

It is important to note that badges are impermanent and therefore it can not be assumed that the current skill level of a candidate will be the same in the next six month period.  The skills development profile should not only be concerned with obtaining and advancing current skills it should also cover maintenance of existing skills.  It will not always be possible to maintain all skills and it must be accepted that sometimes you loose one and gain another.


## 1.2 Discuss profile and agree
The line manager will then sit with the assesee to discuss the profile and to identify any particular blockers to a successful outcome.  It is possible that the assesee may require training or support and it is the responsibility of the line manager to remove these blockers in the same way a scrum master would do in an agile team.


## 2.0 Discuss development profile in detail / fine tune objectives.
After three months from the preparation of the skills development profile the line manager and report sit down and discuss progress. Blockers should be identified and constantly removed during the regular management scrum but this is an opportunity to take a honest assessment of the potential success in achieving the goals.  When there is an impossibility of receiving a badge due to any reason then the skills development profile should be adjusted to remove this goal and potentially suggest another.


## 3.0 Confess your sins - remove blockers
Every fortnight to tie in with the end of the regular retrospective the line manager should have an informal meeting with their reports to discuss the progress with their skills development and to assess any potential blockers that may exist.  This can take place during a one-to-one meeting or could be done over a chat by the water cooler however it would be best to do this in a team environment as the ideal outcome is that the team starts to help themselves.  The intention is not to spend a lot of time discussing finer detail of progress but to raise awareness of the skill development process and to identify any areas where management need to take action or offer support.  Consider asking a simple question... "Is there anything that is stopping you from achieving your goals?" If the answer is no, then move along.
