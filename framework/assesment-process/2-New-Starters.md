# New Starters
The new starter assessment flow is slightly different from the quarterly assessment however the concept is the same.  It is designed to encourage all employees to advance their skills and grow as developers.  The intention is to provide a development plan for new starters immediately setting out what is expected from them in the first three months with the company.  Post probation the flow returns to the standard twice yearly assessment.

## 1.0 Initial Rough Assessment
It is important for new starters to be assessed before a formal offer is made, this allows the recruiter to determine what salary is appropriate to ensure they are inline with market and other members of the team.  Assessment is completed by the recruitment team assigning badges based upon perceived ability.  Obviously it is not possible to accurately assess and complete any required examinations however we are trying to match salary to ability.  
One of the core concepts of the framework is to fairly reward people for the work they do however any imbalance in starting salary can be corrected as the process progresses.

## 2.0 Complete Assessment by New Employee
Once the new starter has commenced employment it is important to assess them fully against the framework.  This assessment replaces the initial one which was performed by the recruiter and must be done as soon as possible in order for the line manager to create a personal development profile.

## 2.1 Prepare Personal Development Profile
Using the results of the complete assessment a personal development profile containing skills and KPI’s to be attained and maintained in order to satisfy probation.  Consideration of initial assessment performed by recruiter and actual assessment performed by the employee must be taken at this stage.  Should someone not be vastly under-performing the initial assessment then the probation period gives them an opportunity to improve however the requirement for this improvement is to be marked on the personal development profile.  Minor underperformance or over performance is not considered at this stage.

## 3.0 End of Probation Re-assess Against Framework
At the end of the probation period re-run the assessment process and compare the results to the objectives set in the PDP should satisfactory criteria be met then the line manager updates the PDP for the next three months at which point the new employee transitions on the standard bi-annual cycle.  If underperformance is identified then the line manager can use their judgment whether to extend the probation period or to terminate employment.
In the case of minor underperformance this can be balanced through the standard assessment process (pay rises are only awarded when their skills are higher than their current remuneration)  In the instance of underperformance an engineer will not be financially rewarded purely for gaining skills if their current remuneration is higher than their current skill level.  This method allows us to balance any guesstimates made when offering initial salary. In some instances a new developer may not a receive pay rise other than inflation or market adjustment for 18 months.  Should an engineer exceed initial guesstimates then positive adjustment can be made at the standard bi-annual assessment cycle.

Engineers must be positively encouraged to better themselves and the line manager must provide full support in order for them to attain this.

IT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS FRAMEWORK TO CREATE A PUNITIVE SYSTEM.  THE SKILLS MATRIX MUST NEVER BE USED AS A METHOD OF CRITICISM OR FOR PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT, STANDARD HR PROCESS IS TO BE USED IN THESE INSTANCES.  IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE POSITIVE FEEDBACK AND SUPPORT TO ALLOW ENGINEERS TO PROGRESS WITH THEIR CAREERS AND DEVELOP THEIR SKILL SETS.
